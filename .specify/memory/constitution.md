# OpenAero Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Community-Driven Innovation
Every feature and decision must prioritize community value and creator empowerment. The platform serves as a bridge between drone creators and professional clients, ensuring 50% profit sharing for creators and certified quality for customers. All development must align with the dual value proposition of empowering creators while delivering reliable solutions to clients.

### II. Quality-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All solutions must undergo rigorous certification with 50+ laboratory and field tests before platform inclusion. Performance validation reports are mandatory. Security and reliability guarantees must be documented. The "OpenAero Certified" brand standard is non-negotiable and requires comprehensive testing protocols.

### III. Microservices-First Design
The platform MUST be built on a scalable microservices architecture using Next.js 14+, TypeScript 5+, and modern cloud technologies. Each service must be independently deployable, testable, and maintainable. API Gateway (Kong/AWS), service discovery (Consul/Kubernetes), and comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger) are mandatory.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all development: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Unit tests (Jest), integration tests, and E2E tests (Playwright) must achieve >80% coverage. All PRs must include comprehensive test coverage.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
Structured logging, performance monitoring, and error tracking are mandatory. All services must implement Prometheus metrics, ELK stack logging, and Sentry error tracking. Real-time monitoring dashboards must be available for all critical system components. Performance optimization is an ongoing requirement.

### VI. Security & Compliance
HTTPS encryption, security headers, input validation, rate limiting, and data protection are mandatory. All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Security audits must be conducted regularly. Compliance with data protection regulations is non-negotiable.

## Technology Standards

### Frontend Requirements
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5+ for type safety
- Tailwind CSS 3+ for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Radix UI + Custom Components
- Responsive design mandatory

### Backend Requirements
- Node.js 18+ (LTS)
- PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
- Redis 7+ for caching
- Docker + Kubernetes for deployment
- API-first design with OpenAPI documentation

### Quality Gates
- ESLint + Prettier code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- 80%+ test coverage
- Performance budgets enforced
- Security scanning mandatory

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
All changes require peer review. PRs must include:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance impact analysis
- Security review checklist
- Documentation updates
- Breaking change documentation

### Deployment Standards
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring during deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments required

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Component documentation (Storybook)
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbook documentation for operations
- User guides and tutorials

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be followed by all team members. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change
2. Impact analysis on existing systems
3. Team consensus (2/3 majority)
4. Migration plan for existing code
5. Version bump according to semantic versioning

All PRs and code reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Complexity must be justified with clear business value. Use the development workflow documentation for runtime development guidance.
