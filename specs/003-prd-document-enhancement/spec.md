## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Product Manager Reference (Priority: P1)

As a product manager, I need a comprehensive PRD document that accurately reflects the current implementation status and provides clear guidance for future development phases, so that I can make informed decisions about feature prioritization and resource allocation.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all future development work and strategic planning. Without an accurate PRD, the team cannot effectively plan or execute development tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the PRD document against current implementation and verifying that all sections provide actionable guidance for development teams.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current PRDV2.md document and implemented features, **When** I review the enhanced PRD, **Then** I can clearly see what has been implemented and what remains to be built
2. **Given** the enhanced PRD document, **When** I need to plan the next development sprint, **Then** I have clear functional requirements and success criteria to guide development

---

### User Story 2 - Development Team Planning (Priority: P1)

As a development team lead, I need a detailed technical specification that aligns with the business requirements and current implementation, so that I can create accurate development estimates and technical roadmaps.

**Why this priority**: Development teams need clear technical requirements to estimate effort, plan sprints, and ensure architectural consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the PRD to create development tasks and verifying that all technical requirements are clearly defined and implementable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced PRD document, **When** I create development tasks, **Then** each task has clear acceptance criteria and technical requirements
2. **Given** the current implementation status, **When** I review the PRD, **Then** I can identify gaps between current state and target state

---

### User Story 3 - Stakeholder Communication (Priority: P2)

As a business stakeholder, I need a clear understanding of the platform's current capabilities and future roadmap, so that I can make informed decisions about business strategy and resource investment.

**Why this priority**: Stakeholders need to understand the platform's value proposition and development progress to make strategic decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by presenting the PRD to stakeholders and verifying that they can understand the platform's capabilities and roadmap.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced PRD document, **When** I present it to stakeholders, **Then** they can clearly understand the platform's value proposition and current status
2. **Given** the business requirements in the PRD, **When** I review the implementation status, **Then** I can see progress toward business goals

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the PRD needs to be updated due to changing business requirements?
- How does the PRD handle conflicting requirements between different user personas?
- What happens when technical constraints require changes to the original business requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The enhanced PRD MUST use a modern product document structure, completely redesigned from PRDV2.md
- **FR-002**: The PRD MUST track implementation status at the feature module level for all major platform capabilities
- **FR-003**: The PRD MUST be updated after each development stage (sprint/milestone) to maintain accuracy
- **FR-004**: The PRD MUST use Git version control with Markdown format for collaborative editing
- **FR-005**: The PRD MUST undergo both technical and business review processes before finalization
- **FR-006**: The PRD MUST provide clear functional requirements for all planned features based on PRDV2.md
- **FR-007**: The PRD MUST include detailed user stories with acceptance criteria for each major feature
- **FR-008**: The PRD MUST define measurable success criteria for each feature and the overall platform
- **FR-009**: The PRD MUST include technical architecture requirements aligned with current implementation
- **FR-010**: The PRD MUST provide clear guidance for internationalization and multi-language support
- **FR-011**: The PRD MUST include security and compliance requirements for the platform
- **FR-012**: The PRD MUST define performance and scalability requirements
- **FR-013**: The PRD MUST include monitoring and observability requirements
- **FR-014**: The PRD MUST provide clear guidance for testing and quality assurance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Feature Specification**: Represents a detailed description of a platform capability with requirements, acceptance criteria, and success metrics
- **User Story**: Represents a user's need and expected outcome, including priority and testability requirements
- **Technical Requirement**: Represents a system capability or constraint that must be implemented
- **Success Criteria**: Represents measurable outcomes that define feature completion
- **Implementation Status**: Represents the current state of feature development (completed, in-progress, planned)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The enhanced PRD document uses modern product document structure and covers 100% of features mentioned in PRDV2.md with feature-level implementation status

- **SC-003**: Stakeholders can understand the platform's current capabilities and roadmap within 30 minutes of reviewing the PRD
- **SC-004**: The PRD provides clear guidance for at least 6 months of future development work
- **SC-005**: All functional requirements include testable acceptance criteria
- **SC-006**: The PRD aligns with OpenAero Constitution requirements for quality, security, and community value
- **SC-007**: The PRD is updated after each development stage with 100% accuracy of current implementation status
