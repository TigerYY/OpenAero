## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3 (User Story 1) - Parallel Opportunities
- **T022, T023, T024, T025** can be executed in parallel (different document sections)
- **T026, T027, T028, T029, T030** can be executed in parallel (different feature modules)
- **T031, T032, T033, T034, T035** can be executed in parallel (different validation aspects)

### Phase 4 (User Story 2) - Parallel Opportunities
- **T039, T040, T041, T042** can be executed in parallel (different technical aspects)
- **T043, T044, T045** can be executed in parallel (different workflow components)

### Phase 5 (User Story 3) - Parallel Opportunities
- **T046, T047** can be executed in parallel (different communication tools)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First Approach
1. **Phase 1-2**: Complete all setup and foundational tasks
2. **Phase 3**: Implement User Story 1 (Product Manager Reference) - 18 tasks
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Add User Stories 2 and 3 based on priority and resource availability

### Incremental Delivery
- **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 (T001-T038)
- **Sprint 2**: User Story 2 (T039-T045)
- **Sprint 3**: User Story 3 + Polish (T046-T050)

### Quality Gates
- All tasks must pass validation before proceeding to next phase
- User Story 1 must be complete and tested before starting User Story 2
- All documentation must pass automated validation before final delivery
