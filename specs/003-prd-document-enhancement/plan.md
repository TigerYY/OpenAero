# Implementation Plan: PRD Document Enhancement

**Branch**: `003-prd-document-enhancement` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-prd-document-enhancement/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a comprehensive, modern PRD document that accurately reflects the current implementation status of the OpenAero platform and provides clear guidance for future development. The enhanced PRD will use a modern product document structure, track implementation status at the feature module level, and be maintained through Git version control with Markdown format. The document will undergo both technical and business review processes and be updated after each development stage to maintain accuracy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown with Git version control  
**Primary Dependencies**: Git, Markdown parser, documentation generation tools  
**Storage**: Git repository with Markdown files  
**Testing**: Documentation validation, link checking, format validation  
**Target Platform**: Web-based documentation accessible via GitHub/GitLab  
**Project Type**: Documentation project - structured content management  
**Performance Goals**: Fast rendering, searchable content, easy navigation  
**Constraints**: Must be maintainable by non-technical stakeholders, version controlled, collaborative editing friendly  
**Scale/Scope**: Single comprehensive PRD document covering entire OpenAero platform with feature-level implementation tracking

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**OpenAero Constitution Compliance Checklist:**
- [x] Community-Driven Innovation: PRD serves both creators and clients with clear value proposition and tracks 50% profit sharing model
- [x] Quality-First Architecture: PRD includes certification requirements and testing protocols for "OpenAero Certified" standards
- [x] Microservices-First Design: PRD documents microservices architecture and independent deployment capabilities
- [x] Test-Driven Development: PRD includes comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance guidance
- [x] Observability & Monitoring: PRD includes monitoring and observability requirements for platform components
- [x] Security & Compliance: PRD addresses security measures and compliance requirements
- [x] Technology Standards: PRD documents approved tech stack (Next.js 14+, TypeScript 5+, etc.)
- [x] Quality Gates: PRD includes code review, testing, and deployment standards

**Post-Design Validation**: All constitution requirements have been addressed in the design phase. The enhanced PRD system includes comprehensive tracking of community value, quality standards, technical architecture, testing requirements, and monitoring capabilities. The design supports both technical and business review processes as required by the constitution.

**Structure Decision**: Documentation-focused structure with templates and automation scripts for PRD maintenance. The enhanced PRD will be a single comprehensive document with supporting templates and automated validation tools.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
