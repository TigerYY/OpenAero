# Research: PRD Document Enhancement

**Feature**: 003-prd-document-enhancement  
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Modern Product Document Structure Research

**Research Question**: What are the best practices for modern product requirement documents in 2025?

**Findings**:
- **Decision**: Adopt Atlassian Confluence-style structure with clear sections and visual hierarchy
- **Rationale**: Provides excellent readability for both technical and business stakeholders, supports collaborative editing, and integrates well with Git workflows
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Traditional PRD format (too rigid, not modern)
  - Notion-style documentation (too complex for Git version control)
  - GitHub Wiki format (limited formatting options)

### Task 2: Implementation Status Tracking Best Practices

**Research Question**: How should implementation status be tracked at the feature module level?

**Findings**:
- **Decision**: Use a standardized status matrix with clear definitions for each status level
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent tracking across all features, enables automated reporting, and supports both technical and business visibility
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Simple checkbox system (too basic, lacks detail)
  - Complex project management integration (too heavy for documentation)
  - Custom status tracking system (maintenance overhead)

### Task 3: Git-based Documentation Workflow

**Research Question**: What are the best practices for collaborative documentation using Git and Markdown?

**Findings**:
- **Decision**: Use Git with Markdown, implement PR-based review process, and maintain clear commit conventions
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing Git infrastructure, provides full version history, supports collaborative editing through PRs, and maintains audit trail
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Google Docs integration (version control issues)
  - Dedicated documentation platforms (additional cost and complexity)
  - Wiki systems (limited Git integration)

### Task 4: Review Process Design

**Research Question**: How should technical and business review processes be structured for documentation?

**Findings**:
- **Decision**: Implement two-stage review: technical review for accuracy and completeness, business review for alignment and clarity
- **Rationale**: Ensures both technical accuracy and business alignment, provides clear ownership, and maintains quality standards
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Single review process (insufficient coverage)
  - Complex multi-stage review (too slow for agile development)
  - Automated review only (lacks human judgment)

### Task 5: Documentation Maintenance Automation

**Research Question**: What automation tools can help maintain documentation accuracy and consistency?

**Findings**:
- **Decision**: Implement automated validation scripts for format checking, link validation, and status consistency
- **Rationale**: Reduces manual maintenance overhead, catches errors early, and ensures consistency across updates
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Manual maintenance only (error-prone and time-consuming)
  - Full CI/CD integration (overkill for documentation)
  - Third-party documentation platforms (vendor lock-in)

## Consolidated Findings

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Document Structure**: Modern, hierarchical structure with clear visual separation
2. **Status Tracking**: Feature-level status matrix with standardized definitions
3. **Version Control**: Git-based workflow with PR reviews
4. **Review Process**: Two-stage technical and business review
5. **Automation**: Validation scripts for consistency and accuracy

### Technology Choices

- **Format**: Markdown with Git version control
- **Validation**: Custom JavaScript validation scripts
- **Review**: GitHub/GitLab PR-based review process
- **Templates**: Standardized Markdown templates for consistency

### Implementation Strategy

- Start with comprehensive PRD structure design
- Implement status tracking system
- Create validation and maintenance scripts
- Establish review process and workflows
- Document templates and guidelines

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 1 design with the research findings integrated into the data model and contract specifications.
