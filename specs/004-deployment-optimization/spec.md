## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Resolve Build Failures (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need the application to build successfully on remote servers so that I can deploy updates without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Build failures prevent any deployment and block all development progress. This is the foundational requirement for all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `npm run build` on a clean server environment and verifying successful compilation without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean server environment, **When** running the build command, **Then** the build completes successfully without TypeScript errors
2. **Given** a production environment, **When** deploying the application, **Then** all components render correctly without hydration errors
3. **Given** a development environment, **When** running type checking, **Then** all type errors are resolved

---

### User Story 2 - Optimize TypeScript Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need TypeScript configuration that works consistently across local and remote environments so that I can develop and deploy without configuration conflicts.

**Why this priority**: TypeScript strict mode conflicts are causing the majority of build failures and need immediate resolution.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `npm run type-check` and verifying zero TypeScript errors across all files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current codebase, **When** running type checking, **Then** no TypeScript errors are reported
2. **Given** optional properties in interfaces, **When** setting them to undefined, **Then** TypeScript accepts the assignment without errors
3. **Given** server-side code, **When** using browser APIs, **Then** appropriate type guards prevent runtime errors

---

### User Story 3 - Fix SSR/CSR Boundary Issues (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need clear separation between server-side and client-side code so that the application renders correctly in both environments.

**Why this priority**: SSR/CSR conflicts cause hydration errors and prevent proper server-side rendering, which is critical for SEO and performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application and verifying no hydration warnings in the browser console.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a page with client components, **When** rendering on the server, **Then** no browser-specific APIs are called
2. **Given** a page with server components, **When** hydrating on the client, **Then** the initial render matches the server render
3. **Given** form validation code, **When** running on the server, **Then** File API usage is properly guarded

---

### User Story 4 - Update Dependencies (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need up-to-date dependencies so that the application uses stable, supported versions and avoids compatibility issues.

**Why this priority**: Outdated dependencies cause API compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities, but this can be addressed after core build issues are resolved.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `npm update` and verifying all tests pass with updated dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** outdated dependencies, **When** updating to latest compatible versions, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work
2. **Given** web-vitals dependency, **When** updating to latest version, **Then** monitoring functions work with new API
3. **Given** next-intl dependency, **When** updating configuration, **Then** internationalization continues to function

---

### User Story 5 - Clean Up Unused Code (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need a clean codebase without unused variables and dead code so that the codebase is maintainable and build warnings are minimized.

**Why this priority**: Unused code increases bundle size and creates confusion, but doesn't prevent deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running ESLint and verifying no unused variable warnings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current codebase, **When** running linting, **Then** no unused variable warnings are reported
2. **Given** unused imports, **When** removing them, **Then** functionality remains unchanged
3. **Given** dead code, **When** removing it, **Then** build size is reduced

---

### User Story 6 - Simplify Internationalization (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need simplified i18n configuration so that language switching works reliably without complex setup.

**Why this priority**: Complex i18n setup increases build complexity and potential failure points, but basic functionality should work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching languages in the application and verifying all text updates correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the language switcher, **When** changing languages, **Then** all text updates to the selected language
2. **Given** server-side rendering, **When** loading pages, **Then** correct language is used for initial render
3. **Given** missing translations, **When** displaying content, **Then** fallback to default language

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when TypeScript strict mode is disabled but code still has type issues?
- How does system handle missing translation keys during server-side rendering?
- What happens when dependencies have conflicting peer dependency requirements?
- How does system handle File API usage in server-side validation?
- What happens when Prisma types don't match TypeScript interfaces?
