## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First Approach
**Phase 1-5 (User Stories 1-3)**: Core build and configuration fixes
- Focus on resolving build failures and TypeScript issues
- Establish proper SSR/CSR boundaries
- Ensure basic functionality works

### Incremental Delivery
**Phase 6-8 (User Stories 4-6)**: Enhancement and optimization
- Update dependencies progressively
- Clean up codebase
- Simplify internationalization

**Phase 9**: Final integration and verification
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance validation
- Deployment verification

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- **Setup tasks**: Can run in parallel (T003-T005)
- **Foundational tasks**: Can run in parallel (T006-T010)
- **User Story tasks**: Within each story, file-specific tasks can run in parallel
- **Cross-cutting tasks**: Can run in parallel (T052-T058)

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must pass its independent test before proceeding
- Build must succeed after each user story
- No TypeScript errors after Phase 4
- No hydration warnings after Phase 5
- All tests must pass after Phase 6
- ESLint must pass after Phase 7
- Language switching must work after Phase 8

### Risk Mitigation
- Create backups before making changes
- Test each phase independently
- Maintain rollback capability
- Monitor build performance throughout
- Validate functionality after each change

## Success Criteria Validation

- [ ] **SC-001**: Build process completes successfully with acceptable build time
- [ ] **SC-002**: Zero TypeScript errors reported during type checking
- [ ] **SC-003**: Zero hydration warnings in browser console
- [ ] **SC-004**: All dependencies updated to latest compatible versions
- [ ] **SC-005**: ESLint reports zero unused variable warnings
- [ ] **SC-006**: Language switching completes in under 1 second
- [ ] **SC-007**: Server-side rendering produces identical output to client-side hydration
- [ ] **SC-008**: Application deploys successfully on first attempt

## Notes

- All tasks follow the strict checklist format with proper IDs and file paths
- Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation
- Parallel execution opportunities are clearly marked with [P]
- Each user story has clear independent test criteria
- Implementation strategy prioritizes MVP delivery with incremental enhancement
