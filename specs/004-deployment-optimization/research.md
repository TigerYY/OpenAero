# Research: Deployment Optimization

**Feature**: 004-deployment-optimization  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for deployment optimization

## TypeScript Configuration Optimization

**Decision**: Adjust TypeScript strict mode settings to maintain type safety while allowing necessary flexibility

**Rationale**: 
- Current `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` causes build failures when setting optional properties to `undefined`
- Need to balance type safety with practical development needs
- Maintain strict type checking for critical areas while allowing flexibility for optional properties

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete strict mode removal: Rejected due to loss of type safety benefits
- Code refactoring only: Rejected due to time constraints and complexity
- Gradual strict mode adoption: Considered but not suitable for immediate deployment needs

**Implementation approach**:
- Adjust `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` to `false` temporarily
- Implement proper type guards for server-side code
- Use union types for optional properties where appropriate
- Maintain strict mode for other type checking features

## SSR/CSR Boundary Management

**Decision**: Implement clear separation between server and client components with proper type guards

**Rationale**:
- Hydration errors occur when server and client render different content
- Browser APIs (like `File`) are not available on the server
- Need clear boundaries to prevent runtime errors

**Alternatives considered**:
- Universal rendering: Rejected due to performance implications
- Client-only components: Rejected due to SEO requirements
- Server-only components: Rejected due to interactivity needs

**Implementation approach**:
- Use `'use client'` directive for interactive components
- Implement runtime checks for browser APIs
- Separate server and client validation logic
- Use proper Next.js App Router patterns

## Progressive Dependency Updates

**Decision**: Implement progressive updates ensuring backward compatibility

**Rationale**:
- Sudden updates can break existing functionality
- Need to maintain system stability during updates
- Security updates are critical but must be tested

**Alternatives considered**:
- Big bang updates: Rejected due to high risk
- Manual updates only: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
- Automated updates: Rejected due to lack of control

**Implementation approach**:
- Update dependencies in batches by priority
- Test each batch thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain compatibility layers where needed
- Use semantic versioning for safe updates

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Implement graceful degradation with fallback behavior

**Rationale**:
- Users should have a functional experience even when errors occur
- Core functionality must remain available
- Error recovery should be automatic where possible

**Alternatives considered**:
- Strict failure mode: Rejected due to poor user experience
- Silent error handling: Rejected due to debugging difficulties
- User-controlled error handling: Rejected due to complexity

**Implementation approach**:
- Implement try-catch blocks for critical operations
- Provide fallback UI for failed components
- Log errors for debugging while maintaining functionality
- Use error boundaries for React components

## Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Prioritize runtime performance while maintaining acceptable build times

**Rationale**:
- User experience is directly impacted by runtime performance
- Build time is a developer concern, not user concern
- Performance optimizations benefit all users

**Alternatives considered**:
- Build speed priority: Rejected due to user experience impact
- Balanced optimization: Considered but runtime performance is more critical
- No optimization: Rejected due to performance requirements

**Implementation approach**:
- Optimize bundle size and loading times
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize critical rendering path

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive testing for core functionality with sampling for edge cases

**Rationale**:
- Core functionality must be thoroughly tested
- Edge cases are important but less critical
- Testing resources should be focused on high-impact areas

**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal testing: Rejected due to quality requirements
- Exhaustive testing: Rejected due to resource constraints
- Risk-based testing: Considered but core functionality is more important

**Implementation approach**:
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- E2E tests for main user journeys
- Sampling tests for edge cases and error scenarios
