# Implementation Plan: Deployment Optimization

**Branch**: `004-deployment-optimization` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-deployment-optimization/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Resolve remote deployment build failures through TypeScript configuration optimization, SSR/CSR boundary fixes, dependency updates, and code cleanup. Technical approach: Adjust TypeScript strict mode settings for flexibility while maintaining type safety, implement proper server/client component separation, progressive dependency updates with backward compatibility, and comprehensive testing strategy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3.3, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14.1.0, React 18.2.0, Prisma 5.8.1, next-intl 4.4.0  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM  
**Testing**: Jest 29.7.0, Playwright 1.40.1, ESLint 8.56.0  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Ubuntu 24.04), Docker containers  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: Build completion in acceptable time, runtime performance prioritized, language switching <1s  
**Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility, graceful degradation for errors, zero hydration warnings  
**Scale/Scope**: Production deployment optimization, 6 user stories, 11 functional requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**OpenAero Constitution Compliance Checklist:**

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js full-stack application with App Router, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM. The structure supports both server-side and client-side rendering with clear separation of concerns through component organization and proper i18n support.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
