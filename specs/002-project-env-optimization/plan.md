# Implementation Plan: Project Environment Optimization

**Branch**: `002-project-env-optimization` | **Date**: 2024-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-project-env-optimization/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Optimize the OpenAero project's development environment to ensure reliable server startup, clean project structure, and automated setup processes. This addresses critical issues with TypeScript compilation errors, missing scripts, and inconsistent configuration that prevent normal development workflow.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+, Node.js 18+ (LTS), Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Playwright  
**Storage**: N/A (configuration and build artifacts only)  
**Testing**: Jest (unit), Playwright (E2E), TypeScript compiler validation  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform development environment (macOS, Linux, Windows)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js monorepo)  
**Performance Goals**: Development server startup <30 seconds, TypeScript compilation <10 seconds  
**Constraints**: Must work across different Node.js versions, handle port conflicts gracefully, maintain backward compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Single development team (5-10 developers), ~50 source files, 3 main configuration files

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**OpenAero Constitution Compliance Checklist:**
- [x] Community-Driven Innovation: Feature serves creators and clients by ensuring reliable development environment that enables faster feature delivery
- [x] Quality-First Architecture: Includes comprehensive testing strategy for environment setup and validation with clear quality gates
- [x] Microservices-First Design: Maintains clean project structure that supports independent development and deployment
- [x] Test-Driven Development: Comprehensive test strategy with automated validation scripts and >80% coverage for configuration testing
- [x] Observability & Monitoring: Includes logging and monitoring for development environment health and performance
- [x] Security & Compliance: Addresses security in configuration management and dependency validation
- [x] Technology Standards: Uses approved tech stack (Next.js 14+, TypeScript 5+, Node.js 18+)
- [x] Quality Gates: Includes code review requirements for configuration changes and automated validation

**Post-Design Validation**: All constitution requirements have been addressed through comprehensive research, data modeling, API design, and implementation planning. The solution maintains OpenAero standards while providing robust environment optimization capabilities.

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js web application with clear separation of concerns. The structure follows Next.js 14+ App Router conventions with organized component hierarchy, utility libraries, and comprehensive testing setup. Configuration files are centralized at the root level for easy access and maintenance.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
