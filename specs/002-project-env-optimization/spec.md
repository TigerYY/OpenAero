# Feature Specification: Project Environment Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `002-project-env-optimization`  
**Created**: 2024-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "当前项目环境配置和文件结构等有严重问题，导致项目启动卡住失败，需要重新检查并优化"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Reliable Development Server Startup (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on the OpenAero project, I need to be able to start the development server consistently and reliably so that I can focus on feature development rather than troubleshooting environment issues.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all development work. Without a working development environment, no other features can be developed or tested.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the development startup command and verifying the server responds within 30 seconds without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean project directory, **When** I run the development startup command, **Then** the server should start successfully on the expected port
2. **Given** the server is already running, **When** I attempt to start another instance, **Then** the system should handle port conflicts gracefully
3. **Given** there are TypeScript compilation errors, **When** I start the development server, **Then** the server should either start with warnings or provide clear error messages

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Project Structure and Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need a well-organized project structure with clear configuration files so that I can easily understand and maintain the codebase.

**Why this priority**: A clean project structure is essential for maintainability, onboarding new developers, and preventing configuration conflicts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining the project structure and verifying all configuration files are properly organized and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I examine the project root directory, **When** I look for configuration files, **Then** I should find them in logical, standard locations
2. **Given** I check the package.json file, **When** I review the scripts section, **Then** all scripts should be properly defined and functional
3. **Given** I examine the TypeScript configuration, **When** I check for compilation errors, **Then** the configuration should be valid and complete

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Environment Setup and Validation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need automated tools to set up and validate the development environment so that I can quickly get started on any machine.

**Why this priority**: Reduces onboarding time and prevents environment-related issues from blocking development.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the setup script on a clean environment and verifying all dependencies and configurations are properly installed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh machine with Node.js installed, **When** I run the project setup script, **Then** all dependencies should be installed and configured correctly
2. **Given** the project is set up, **When** I run the environment validation script, **Then** it should verify all required components are working
3. **Given** there are missing dependencies, **When** I run the setup script, **Then** it should install them automatically

---

### User Story 4 - Clear Documentation and Troubleshooting Guide (Priority: P2)

As a developer encountering issues, I need clear documentation and troubleshooting guides so that I can resolve problems quickly without external help.

**Why this priority**: Reduces support burden and enables developers to be self-sufficient.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following the documentation to set up the environment and resolve common issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I encounter a startup error, **When** I consult the troubleshooting guide, **Then** I should find specific steps to resolve the issue
2. **Given** I need to understand the project structure, **When** I read the documentation, **Then** I should find clear explanations of each component
3. **Given** I want to contribute to the project, **When** I follow the setup guide, **Then** I should be able to get the environment running successfully

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple developers try to start the server simultaneously?
- How does the system handle corrupted configuration files?
- What happens when required dependencies are missing or incompatible?
- How does the system handle different operating systems and Node.js versions?
- What happens when port 3000 is occupied by another application?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a reliable development server startup process that works consistently across different environments
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize configuration files in standard, logical locations following industry best practices
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate all configuration files and dependencies before starting the development server
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear error messages when startup fails, including specific steps to resolve issues
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle port conflicts gracefully by either using alternative ports or providing clear instructions
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain a clean project structure with clear separation of concerns
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide automated setup scripts that can configure the environment from scratch
- **FR-008**: System MUST include comprehensive documentation for setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate TypeScript configuration and provide clear compilation error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all npm scripts are properly defined and functional

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
