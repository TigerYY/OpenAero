- [ ] Implement language-specific URLs

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (4 days)

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Test i18n service functions
- [ ] Test language switching logic
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test server-side language detection

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test component translation switching
- [ ] Test page navigation with language persistence
- [ ] Test form validation in both languages
- [ ] Test error handling for missing translations

### 4.3 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete user journey in both languages
- [ ] Test language switching across all pages
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness in both languages
- [ ] Test accessibility compliance

### 4.4 Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure i18n bundle size impact
- [ ] Test page load times with i18n
- [ ] Optimize translation loading
- [ ] Validate performance requirements

## Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (3 days)

### 5.1 Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy i18n configuration to production
- [ ] Test production language detection
- [ ] Verify localStorage functionality
- [ ] Validate all translations in production

### 5.2 Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Add language usage analytics
- [ ] Monitor translation loading errors
- [ ] Track language switching patterns
- [ ] Set up alerts for missing translations

### 5.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create translation management guide
- [ ] Document language switching implementation
- [ ] Update deployment procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
- **Translation Quality**: Implement translation review process
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor bundle size and load times
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across all supported browsers
- **SEO Impact**: Implement proper hreflang and meta tags

### Contingency Plans
- **Fallback Strategy**: Display translation keys for missing content
- **Performance Issues**: Implement lazy loading for translations
- **Browser Issues**: Provide server-side fallback
- **Translation Errors**: Implement validation and error reporting

## Success Metrics
