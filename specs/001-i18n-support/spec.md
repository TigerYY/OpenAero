## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Language Selection and Display (Priority: P1)

As a website visitor, I want to switch between Chinese and English languages so that I can understand the content in my preferred language.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables international users to access the platform, directly supporting the community-driven mission of OpenAero.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the website, using the language switcher, and verifying all visible text changes to the selected language.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the website for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** the content displays in Chinese (zh-CN) as default language
2. **Given** a user is viewing the website in Chinese, **When** they click the English (en-US) language option in the header navigation, **Then** all text content switches to English
3. **Given** a user is viewing the website in English, **When** they click the Chinese language option in the header navigation, **Then** all text content switches to Chinese
4. **Given** a user has selected a language, **When** they navigate to different pages, **Then** the language preference is maintained across all pages via localStorage
5. **Given** a user has JavaScript disabled, **When** they visit the website, **Then** the system detects their browser language and displays content accordingly, defaulting to Chinese if detection fails
6. **Given** a translation is missing, **When** the page loads, **Then** the translation key (e.g., "common.welcome") is displayed instead of breaking the interface

### User Story 2 - Content Localization (Priority: P1)

As a content consumer, I want to see all website content (navigation, headings, descriptions, buttons) in my selected language so that I can fully understand and use the platform.

**Why this priority**: Without localized content, the language switcher provides no value. This is essential for the basic internationalization functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching languages and verifying that all visible text elements (navigation, headings, buttons, descriptions) are properly translated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user selects English (en-US), **When** they view any page, **Then** all navigation menus, headings, and button text appear in English
2. **Given** a user selects Chinese (zh-CN), **When** they view any page, **Then** all navigation menus, headings, and button text appear in Chinese
3. **Given** a user views product descriptions and user comments, **When** they switch languages, **Then** all content displays in the selected language or shows translation keys
4. **Given** a user interacts with forms, **When** they switch languages, **Then** form labels and validation messages appear in the selected language

### User Story 3 - Language Preference Persistence (Priority: P2)

As a returning user, I want my language preference to be remembered so that I don't have to select it again on future visits.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience and reduces friction for international users, supporting long-term platform adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a language, closing the browser, reopening the website, and verifying the language preference is maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user selects English (en-US) and closes their browser, **When** they return to the website, **Then** the content displays in English via localStorage
2. **Given** a user selects Chinese (zh-CN) and navigates away, **When** they return within the same session, **Then** the content remains in Chinese
3. **Given** a user has no language preference set, **When** they visit the website, **Then** the content defaults to Chinese with server-side browser language detection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a translation is missing for a specific text element? → Display translation key (e.g., "common.welcome")
- How does the system handle very long text that might break layout in different languages? → Use responsive design and text truncation
- What happens when a user has JavaScript disabled but wants to change languages? → Server-side browser language detection with Chinese fallback
- How does the system handle right-to-left languages in the future (if applicable)? → Future enhancement using CSS logical properties

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display all user-facing text in the user's selected language
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a language switcher component in the header navigation bar (right side)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support Chinese (zh-CN) and English (en-US) languages using standard ISO codes
- **FR-004**: System MUST default to Chinese language for new users
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist language preference in localStorage across browser sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain language selection when navigating between pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle missing translations by displaying translation keys (e.g., "common.welcome")
- **FR-008**: System MUST support dynamic text content including static text, product descriptions, and user comments
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide consistent translation quality across all content
- **FR-010**: System MUST support future addition of new languages without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect browser language server-side for users with JavaScript disabled
- **FR-012**: System MUST fallback to Chinese when browser language detection fails

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Language Preference**: User's selected language setting, stored locally or in user profile
- **Translation Content**: Text content organized by language keys and values
- **Language Switcher**: UI component that allows users to select their preferred language

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can switch between Chinese (zh-CN) and English (en-US) languages in under 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: 100% of content (static text, product descriptions, user comments) is properly translated for both supported languages
- **SC-003**: Language preference persists correctly in localStorage for 95% of users across browser sessions
- **SC-004**: Website loads in the user's selected language within 3 seconds of page load, with server-side browser language detection
- **SC-005**: Language switching works consistently across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **SC-006**: No broken layouts or text overflow issues occur when switching between languages
- **SC-007**: Missing translations display translation keys (e.g., "common.welcome") instead of breaking the interface
- **SC-008**: Language switcher is properly positioned in header navigation bar (right side) on all pages
- **SC-009**: System gracefully handles users with JavaScript disabled via server-side language detection
