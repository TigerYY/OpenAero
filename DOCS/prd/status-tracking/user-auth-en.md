## Overview

### Description
Secure user authentication system with multi-factor authentication support and comprehensive user profile management for the OpenAero platform.

### Business Value
Enables secure access to the platform for all users, protects sensitive data, and provides the foundation for role-based access control and user management.

### User Impact
Users can securely register, log in, and manage their accounts with confidence that their data is protected and their access is properly controlled.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-002**: Users can log in securely with credentials
- **FR-003**: Multi-factor authentication is supported
- **FR-004**: Password reset functionality works
- **FR-005**: User profiles can be created and updated
- **FR-006**: Role-based access control is implemented

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Authentication response time <500ms
- **NFR-002**: Password hashing with bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- **NFR-003**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- **NFR-004**: Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Criteria
- [x] Users can register with email and password
- [x] Users can log in securely with MFA support
- [x] Password reset functionality works
- [x] User profiles can be created and updated
- [x] Role-based access control is implemented

### Secondary Criteria
- [x] Social login integration (Google, GitHub)
- [x] Session management and timeout
- [x] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [x] Email verification for new accounts

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
The authentication system is built using Next.js API routes with JWT tokens, integrated with NextAuth.js for session management and OAuth providers.

### Data Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // hashed
  name: string;
  role: 'creator' | 'client' | 'admin';
  emailVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Session {
  user: User;
  expires: Date;
  token: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
- **POST /api/auth/register** - User registration
- **POST /api/auth/login** - User login
- **POST /api/auth/logout** - User logout
- **POST /api/auth/reset-password** - Password reset
- **GET /api/auth/session** - Get current session
- **PUT /api/auth/profile** - Update user profile

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'client',
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### External Dependencies
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework
- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token management
- **nodemailer**: Email sending for verification

## Implementation Details

### Development Tasks
- [x] Set up NextAuth.js configuration
- [x] Implement user registration API
- [x] Implement user login API
- [x] Add password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Implement JWT token management
- [x] Add MFA support with TOTP
- [x] Create user profile management
- [x] Implement role-based access control
- [x] Add password reset functionality
- [x] Integrate OAuth providers

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual authentication functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user registration and login flows
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning

### Performance Considerations
- JWT tokens are stateless for scalability
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Session data is cached in Redis

### Security Considerations
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens are signed and verified
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement for all auth endpoints

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a** platform user, **I want** to securely register and log in to my account, **so that** I can access the platform features and protect my data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I register with valid email and password, **Then** I receive a verification email and can log in
2. **Given** I have an account, **When** I log in with correct credentials, **Then** I am authenticated and redirected to the dashboard

### Secondary User Stories
**As a** user, **I want** to reset my password if I forget it, **so that** I can regain access to my account.

**As a** user, **I want** to enable two-factor authentication, **so that** my account is more secure.

## Implementation Status

### Current Status
✅ **Completed** - All authentication features are implemented and tested.

### Completed Items
- [x] User registration with email verification
- [x] Secure login with password validation
- [x] Multi-factor authentication (TOTP)
- [x] Password reset functionality
- [x] User profile management
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- [x] Session management
- [x] Security testing and audit

### In Progress Items
- [ ] None

### Blocked Items
- [ ] None

### Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor authentication metrics

- [ ] Enhance security features based on user feedback

## Testing

### Test Cases
| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| TC-001 | User registration with valid data | Account created, verification email sent | ✅ Pass |
| TC-002 | User login with correct credentials | Successful authentication | ✅ Pass |
| TC-003 | User login with incorrect password | Authentication failed, rate limiting applied | ✅ Pass |
| TC-004 | Password reset flow | Reset email sent, password updated | ✅ Pass |
| TC-005 | MFA setup and verification | TOTP code generation and validation | ✅ Pass |

### Test Results
All authentication tests are passing. Security audit completed with no critical issues found.

## Risks and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Risk 1**: JWT token compromise - **Mitigation**: Short token expiration, secure storage
- **Risk 2**: Brute force attacks - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting and account lockout
- **Risk 3**: Password reuse - **Mitigation**: Password strength requirements

### Assumptions
- Users will use strong passwords
- Email delivery is reliable
- OAuth providers maintain security standards

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- None (foundational feature)

### External Dependencies
